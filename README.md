# Personal Website

See: [Felixthind.com](https://www.felixthind.com/).

My personal website. Simple, easily modifiable, statically-exportable [React](https://reactjs.org/), application that deploys automatically for free using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Built using modern javascript, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and many other useful technologies.
