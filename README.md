This is my portfolio website.

Build with ReactJs and deployed with Netlify.

Goals: 
1. Need to get emails working and add a contact me Link
2. Get GitHub API to import all my GitHub projects and present them in a tidy manner rather than linking to GitHub - Done
3. Make the Website Responsive
4. Render Resume on the website
